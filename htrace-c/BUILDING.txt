To build the htrace-c client, activate the native profile.  Example:

    mvn package -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Pnative

BUILD DEPENDENCIES
    C compiler
        To compile the sources.

    CMake
        The CMake build system.  Needed to run the native build.  See
        www.cmake.org.  This should be available via "yum install cmake" or
        similar.

    libcurl-devel
        A library to transfer data over HTTP.  See http://curl.haxx.se/dev/.

TEST DEPENDENCIES
    C++ compiler
        To compile some of the unit tests.

    libjson-c
        A library to parse JSON.  This is only used for unit tests.  See

    htraced binary
        You must compile the htraced binaries before running the unit tests.
        You can do this by running "mvn compile" on the top-level project, or
        in the htrace-htraced directory.
