On Building HTrace

Requires the go programming language, version 1.3 or higher.  See
htrace-core/src/go/BUILDING.txt for more information.

Requires Java 1.6 at least.

Requires maven 3.x.

After installing go, to build, run:

 $ mvn install

To build a tarball, do:

 $ mvn clean install -DskipTests assembly:single -Pdist

This will build a tarball into ./target.

To skip the rat-check -- it can take a while -- pass
a -Drat.skip on the  mvn command-line.
