/**
 * Extremely simple callback to determine the frequency that an action should be
 * performed.
 * 
 * 'T' is the object type you require to create a more advanced sampling
 * function. For example if there is some RPC information in a 'Call' object,
 * you might implement Sampler<Call>. Then when the RPC is received you can call
 * one of the Trace.java functions that takes the extra 'info' parameter, which
 * will be passed into the next function you implemented.
 * 
 * For the example above, the next(T info) function may look like this
 * 
 * public boolean next(Call info){
 * 
 *    if (info.getName().equals("get")) {
 *        return Math.random() > 0.5;
 *    } else if (info.getName().equals("put")) {
 *        return Math.random() > 0.25;
 *    } else {
 *      return false;
 *    }
 * }
 * This would trace 50% of all gets, 75% of all puts and would not trace any other requests.
