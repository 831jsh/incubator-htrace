/**
 * The Trace class is the primary way to interact with the library.  It provides
 * methods to create and manipulate spans.
 *
 * A 'Span' represents a length of time.  It has many other attributes such as a
 * description, ID, and even potentially a set of key/value strings attached to
 * it.
 *
 * Each thread in your application has a single currently active currentSpan
 * associated with it.  When this is non-null, it represents the current
 * operation that the thread is doing.  Spans are NOT thread-safe, and must
 * never be used by multiple threads at once.  With care, it is possible to
 * safely pass a Span object between threads, but in most cases this is not
 * necessary.
 *
 * A 'TraceScope' can either be empty, or contain a Span.  TraceScope objects
 * implement the Java's Closeable interface.  Similar to file descriptors, they
 * must be closed after they are created.  When a TraceScope contains a Span,
 * this span is closed when the scope is closed.
 *
 * The 'startSpan' methods in this class do a few things:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Create a new Span which has this thread's currentSpan as one of its parents.</li>
 *   <li>Set currentSpan to the new Span.</li>
 *   <li>Create a TraceSpan object to manage the new Span.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Closing a TraceScope does a few things:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It closes the span which the scope was managing.</li>
 *   <li>Set currentSpan to the previous currentSpan (which may be null).</li>
 * </ul>
