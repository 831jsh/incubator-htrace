//
// Represents a trace span.
//
// Compatibility notes:
// We use signed numbers here, even in cases where unsigned would make more sense.  This is because
// Java doesn't support unsigned integers, and we'd like to match the representation used by the
// Java client.  For example, if we log a message about a span id in the Java client, it would be
// nice if we could match it up with a log message about the same span id in this server, without
// doing a mental conversion from signed to unsigned.
//
// When converting to JSON, we store the 64-bit numbers as strings rather than as integers.  This is
// because JavaScript lacks the ability to handle 64-bit integers.  Numbers above about 55 bits will
// be rounded by Javascript.  Since the Javascript UI is a primary consumer of this JSON data, we
// have to simply pass it as a string.
