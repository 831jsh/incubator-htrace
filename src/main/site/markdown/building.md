# Building HTrace
## Publishing a Release Candidate
### Generating the PGP key (if you haven't already)
Create new pgp key.  See http://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html

    sudo zypper -y install gpg
    gpg --version
    gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.22

This is a new enough version according to the apache site.

Generate a new key via

    gpg --gen-key --s2k-digest-algo sha512

Answer 4096 bits, no expiration time.

Uploaded key to http://pgp.mit.edu/ It now appears as

    http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xDE78987A9CD4D9D3

Get the pgp key signed by others.

Add the new pgp key to the KEYS file

### JIRA maintenance
From hadoop HowToRelease at https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToRelease :
Bulk update Jira to unassign from this release all issues that are open
non-blockers.

#### Maven and build
Update the versions in Maven.

    mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=4.0.0

or do it manually by editing the pom.xml files.  Commit the new versions.

Add a settings.xml in `~/.m2/settings.xml` with the appropriate logins.

Create the release branch:

   git checkout -b 4.0

Create an annotated (signed) release tag via git.

    git tag -s 4.0.0RC0 -m '4.0.0 release candidate 0'

For some reason, I get a message about needing a password.  But no password
is actually asked for.  Perhaps it is supplied by the window manager via its
keyring-like program.

Push branch-X.Y.Z and the newly created tag to the remote repo.

    git push apache 4.0 4.0.0RC0

Upload the build to Sonatype's servers.

    git clean -fdqx .
    mvn clean deploy -Pdist -DskipTests

The above referenced profiles are not in the htrace profile but in the
parent apache profile. Here is a pointer to the parent profile:
[Apache-18.pom](https://repository.apache.org/service/local/repo_groups/public/content/org/apache/apache/18/apache-18.pom)

This will take a while because it needs to upload to the servers.
It will ask you for your key password unless you set up a
gpg-agent for your local session.

Log into repository.apache.org and go to
https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories
Select the repo you uploaded earlier.  You can browse the files
here to verify it looks right.  When you are satisfied, click "Close".

Generate the source tarball via:

    mvn clean install -DskipTests assembly:single -Pdist

Generate the side files.

    gpg --print-mds /home/cmccabe/src/htrace2d/target/htrace-4.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz > \
    /home/cmccabe/src/htrace2d/target/htrace-4.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.mds
    gpg --armor --output /home/cmccabe/src/htrace2d/target/htrace-4.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc \
      --detach-sig /home/cmccabe/src/htrace2d/target/htrace-4.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz

rsync up to your public_html directory in people.apache.org.

    rsync -avi /home/cmccabe/src/htrace2d/target/htrace-4.0.0-incubating-src.tar.* \
    people.apache.org:~/public_html/htrace/releases/4.0.0

Generate release notes via JIRA at
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTRACE/
by clicking on the release and then clicking the grey "release notes"
button in the top right.

## Publishing htrace.incubator.apache.org website
Checkout the current website. It is in svn (that's right, subversion).
The website is in a distinct location such that when its' content is svn
committed, the commit is published as `htrace.incubator.apache.org`.

Here is how you'd check out the current site into a directory named
`htrace.incubator.apache.org` in the current directory:

~~~
 $ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/htrace/site/publish htrace.incubator.apache.org
~~~

Next, run the site publishing script at `${HTRACE_CHECKOUT_DIR}/bin/publish_hbase_website.sh`.
It will dump out usage information that looks like this:

    $ ./bin/publish_hbase_website.sh
    Usage: ./bin/publish_hbase_website.sh [-i | -a] [-g &lt;dir>] [-s &lt;dir>]
    -h          Show this message
    -i          Prompts the user for input
    -a          Does not prompt the user. Potentially dangerous.
    -g          The local location of the HTrace git repository
    -s          The local location of the HTrace website svn checkout
    Either -i or -a is required.
    Edit the script to set default Git and SVN directories.

To run the publish site script interactively, here is an example where
the git checkout is at `~/checkouts/incubator-htrace` and the svn checkout
is at `~/checkouts/htrace.incubator.apache.org`:

~~~
 $ ./bin/publish_hbase_website.sh -i -g ~/checkouts/incubator-htrace -s ~/checkouts/htrace.incubator.apache.org/
~~~
